# Datasets

The dataset library was created to provide a convenient way to represent collections of rows and fields in TypeScript. 

One of the main benefits of using the library is that it provides a structured and type-safe way of working with collections of data. The names and types of the fields in a dataset are specified at construction, providing a clear understanding of what data is stored in the dataset.

Additionally, the Dataset class provides methods for adding, removing, and modifying rows and fields in the dataset and can emit events to subscribers when data is modified. This can be useful for keeping track of changes to a dataset, and for triggering updates to any dependent components or services.

It also includes extensions, such as PersistentDataset, that allow loading, saving and working with persistent data, as well as setting various options related to persistence and reactive writes.

Overall, the library supports the specification of well-defined and flexible structure for working with collections of data, which can improve code organization, readability, and maintainability.
